# Toy Language Interpreter with GUI

This is a Toy Language Interpreter implemented in Java, following the MVC architecture. The interpreter includes a graphical user interface (GUI) designed using Scene Builder. It is capable of handling various features such as dictionaries, heaps, stacks, and lists. It supports different types of expressions including arithmetic expressions, logic expressions, relational expressions, and value expressions. Additionally, it implements various types and values such as boolean, integer, reference, and string. The interpreter also supports a variety of statements including assignment, fork, if, do while, for, compare, repeat, switch, wait, variable declaration, print, write and read heap statements.

## Features

- **MVC Architecture:** The interpreter follows the Model-View-Controller architectural pattern to ensure separation of concerns and maintainability.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Includes a GUI designed using Scene Builder for an intuitive user experience.
- **Expressions:** Supports different types of expressions such as arithmetic, logic, relational, and value expressions.
- **Types and Values:** Implements various types and values including boolean, integer, reference, and string.
- **Statements:** Supports a wide range of statements including assignment, open/close file, fork, if, do while, for, compare, repeat, switch, wait, variable declaration, print, write, and read heap statements.
- **Data Structures:** Implements dictionaries, heaps, stacks, and lists to manage data efficiently.
- **Modular Design:** The interpreter is designed with modularity in mind, making it easy to extend and maintain.

# Learning Opportunities with Toy Language Interpreter and GUI

Implementing a Toy Language Interpreter in Java with a graphical user interface (GUI) designed using Scene Builder presents an excellent opportunity to learn and reinforce various technologies and concepts. Here are some of the key areas I explored and deepen my understanding of:

## Technologies and Skills Learned:
## 1. Java Programming Language
Strengthened my proficiency in Java, including object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, data structures, and design patterns.

## 2. Model-View-Controller (MVC) Architecture
Gained a deeper understanding of MVC architecture by implementing it in a practical project and learned how to separate concerns and organize code effectively.

## 3. Expression Evaluation
Understood how to parse and evaluate different types of expressions, such as arithmetic, logic, relational, and value expressions. Exploreed algorithms for expression evaluation and handling operator precedence.

## 4. Data Structures
Implemented various data structures such as dictionaries, heaps, stacks, and lists to manage program data efficiently. Learned about their characteristics, operations, and trade-offs.

## 5. Statement Interpretation
Implemented different types of statements like assignment, conditionals (if-else), loops (while, for), switch statements, and more. Learned how to handle control flow and execute statements based on runtime conditions.

## 6. Type System
Designed and implemented a type system that supports different types such as boolean, integer, reference, and string. Explored type checking, type inference, and type conversion mechanisms.

## 7. Concurrency
Implemented features like fork and wait statements to handle concurrency in the interpreter. Learned about thread management, synchronization, and inter-process communication.

## 8. I/O Operations
Implemented features like print, write, and read heap statements to handle input and output operations. Learned about file handling, streams, and input/output redirection.

## 9. Graphical User Interface (GUI) Development
Explored GUI development using JavaFX and Scene Builder. Learned how to design and create user-friendly interfaces for my applications. Understood concepts such as layout management, event handling, and styling.

By working on this project, I enhanced my Java programming skills and  gained valuable experience in software architecture, language design, GUI development, and implementation techniques.
